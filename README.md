# Eye-Exercise

## Description
In this project, two divs are generated and styled using CSS to depict an eye. The first div forms an oval, representing the sclera, while the second div, a circular shape, lies within it to signify the eyeball. A third div incorporates two of these elements to construct a pair of eyes, and it is styled to ensure their alignment. Finally, a JavaScript component is employed to track mouse movements, altering the position of both elements representing the eyeballs. This creates the illusion of movement, enhancing the overall visual effect. Enjoy a playful visual experience as the eyes follow your mouse movements.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Move your mouse, and watch the eyes follow your cursor.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
- Incorporate animated nose and mouth for extra expressions triggered by user clicks or element hovers.
- Implement butterfly animation to make the eyes follow a butterfly flying randomly on the screen, adding an extra layer of interactivity and fun.
